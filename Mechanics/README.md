supplier)***    

## Principal Assembly
![plot](./Pictures/Full_arm.png)
The full assembly of the arm consist of 3 parts: the Shoulder, the Upper Arm and the wrist. Each of those part are assembled separately before doing the final assembly.

## Shoulder assembly
![plot](./Pictures/Shoulder.png)
The shoulder is the main part of  Armus Most of the work is done by this part. The first thing to assemble should be the acrylic base with the shafts support. After that bold the two motor support to the main support.
Afterwards put the motor on those little support and plug the shaft to them along with the 14 theet gear. The next step is to place the long shaft with the two big gear and the little box to put the bolt passing trew the bevel gear. Afterwards put the bevel gear between the two main gear And tight the whole with a bolt that goes trew the little box in the middle of the shaft.

## Upper Arm assembly
![plot](./Pictures/Upper_Arm.png)
The Main three parts to assemble are the two parts of the humerus and the L part(the L part is the part that will be link to the shoulder in the final assembly). Afterwards you can mount the motor inside the humerus with the shaft and pass it trought the shaft support.And finally put the 16 theet gear on the shaft.    
***PLA infill 10%-15%***

## Elbow assembly 
![plot](./Pictures/Upper_Arm.png)
For the helbow joint you can take a 6 inch shaft and pass is trought the foreArm and the humerus and add a gear on it.

## Forearm assembly
![plot](./Pictures/ForeArm.png)     
The Forearm will be plug on the helbow joint  and the wrist will be put inside the motor container of the forarms.  
***PLA infill 5%-10%*** 
## Wrist assembly
![plot](./Pictures/Wrist.png)
The Wrist contains two motors. You cand strat by bolting the hand support to the first motor(We will name it number 1). Afterwards bolt the second motor(We will name it number2) underneet the motor number 1 support. Next you can bolt the motor number 1 inside his support.
